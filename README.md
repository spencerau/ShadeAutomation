# ShadeAutomation
Automated window shades and motorized cat perch using Raspberry Pi, with Rust/C++ for motor control and Python for remote access via API.

## Description

This project automates window shades and a motorized cat perch using a Raspberry Pi, integrating Rust/C++ for real-time motor control and Python for high-level automation and remote access. The system supports API-based control via Flask/FastAPI, allowing users to adjust the perch height and shade position remotely. Future enhancements include sensor-driven automation, weight detection for safety, and AI-powered optimizations.
